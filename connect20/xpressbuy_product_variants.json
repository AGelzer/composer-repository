Anywhere a user engages with their brand, shoppers will be able to make purchases without having to go to the retailer\u2019s site. XpressBuy works across all platforms (mobile and desktop), social networks (including Facebook and Twitter), within Apps, within e-mails, and in all types of Advertising (native ads, banner, video, etc.). Allowing buying \u201cin-the-moment\u201d drives higher conversion rates and, thus, higher ROI. Keeping the user \u201cin-the-moment\u201d while simultaneously lowering barriers to purchase (such as automatically retrieving address information from the user\u2019s mobile carrier), drives conversion rates higher by 2X to 6X and drives up average order value by up to 74%.","authors":[{"name":"XpressBuy Inc.","email":"mag@getxpressbuy.com"}],"version":"0.0.2","require":{},"suggest":{"magento-hackathon\/magento-composer-installer":"Allows to manage this package as a dependency"},"dist":{"type":"tar","url":"https:\/\/connect20.magentocommerce.com\/community\/xpressbuy_product_variants\/0.0.2\/xpressbuy_product_variants-0.0.2.tgz"},"extra":{"package-xml":"package.xml"}}}}}
